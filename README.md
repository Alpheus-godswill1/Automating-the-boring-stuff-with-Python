# Automate the Boring Stuff With Python
1. I started this interesting book authomating the boring stuff with python out of the hunger to have a solid background in python. 

# A quick story

`` When I first started coding I actually chose python as my first programming language but along the line I picked PHP, and intentionally built projects with it, I became so engrossed to it that I practically forgot about python, well long story cut short as they say, I am back with my firt love 'PYTHON' ``

-- Well I will document all I have learnt from this classic later
